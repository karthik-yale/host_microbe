# Host-associated micorbiomes

A key step towards rational microbiome engineering is the in silico sampling of realistic microbial communities that correspond to desired host phenotypes, and vice versa. This remains challenging due to a lack of generative models that simultaneously model compositions of host-associated microbiomes and host phenotypes. To that end, we present a machine learning model based on the consumer/resource (C/R) framework. In the model, variation in microbial ecosystem composition arises due to differences in the availability of effective resources (latent variables) while speciesâ€™ resource preferences remain conserved. Variation in the same latent variables is used to model phenotypic variation across hosts. In silico microbiomes generated by our model accurately reproduce universal and dataset-specific statistics of bacterial communities. The model allows us to address two salient questions in microbiome design: (1) which host phenotypes maximally constrain the composition of the host-associated microbiome? and (2) what are plausible microbiome compositions corresponding to user-specified host phenotypes? Thus, our model aids the design and analysis of microbial communities associated with host phenotypes of interest.
